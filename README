MeteoClientV5
=============

My way of arduino based meteostation. (DHT22, CO2 K30, LCD1602)
It's just another arduino meteostation code. Could be usefull for someone to start with if you have the same hardware parts.
In V5 i had 1602 LCD (blue with IIC V1, but i believe that library allows to connect a lot of different screens), DHT22 sensor (AM2302), K30 from CO2Meter. 

In my opinion station should show all the necessary data on screen, so you could actually see what temp is right now. See it without your smartphone.
But to make decisions you'll actually need graphs. In that case it is nice to use local web server on device or any remote service to store and show data. I decided to use narodmon.ru.

To use sketch you'll need to download libraries.

Thank's to everyone who made libraries.
